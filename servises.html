            <p>
              The world of work is changing - fast <br>

Tremendous forces are radically reshaping the workplace. There are new organisational, talent, HR and technology challenges to be faced as business leaders wrestle with disruptive innovation, global trade, skills mismatches and the constant tests of risk and regulation. <br>

Organisations need to redefine the way work gets done and create innovative talent ecosystems that build engaged, enabled and agile workforces. And as they face the future we know that every organisation is different. Each has a unique history, culture, leadership style and capability set in its employees. <br>
At Klasma we build tailored people and organisation solutions to help our clients achieve their strategic ambitions - reflecting their uniqueness but also grounded in rigorous analysis and data-driven insight - to create lasting, differentiated value.​

             <h3 id="ent">Entrepreneurial & private clients</h3>
             <p>
              Growing a business can be demanding and exhilarating. The challenges are enormous, from identifying your proposition, to choosing your team, and ensuring you have a resilient and efficient operating model. And as the business gains ground, new issues emerge: you need the right finance to grow, and the right skills for expansion, whether that's exporting for the first time, developing a digital operation, or broadening your range of products and services. <br>
              We can help you identify and manage the issues that arise in entrepreneurial start-ups, family and private businesses. Whatever your sector, scale or strategy, we'll have experience that's relevant to you, and the expertise to turn ambition into success.

          <h3 id="bui">Business services</h3>
          <p>
            As a business, you face unique challenges. You also have unique strengths. <br>

Where other companies might measure success in quarters, you measure them in generations. Where others might focus uniquely on value, you also focus on values—including preserving the company for the next generation, and perhaps making your mark on the world. <br>

On the other hand, business  dynamics and non-business considerations can derail even the most profitable enterprise—particularly when catalysed by events such as a generational transition, or an external economic crisis. <br>

At Klasma, we know that the most successful firms are those in which there is a good balance between professional management, responsible business ownership and a healthy dynamic. We have a keen understanding of the unique dynamics of business, and we have the tools, experience and focus to help you optimise the positive forces in your enterprise, while anticipating and minimising any conflicts or perturbations. <br>

No matter what your size, industry or market, Klasma's family business advisors are there to assist you. From strategy and governance, to business transition and private wealth, to putting your values in action, we have the tools, people and presence to help you manage your family enterprise and build lasting value. <br>

        <h3 id="fas">Feasibility Studies</h3>
        <p>
          A feasibility study looks at the viability of a business venture or project with an emphasis on identifying potential problems. The study attempts to answer two main questions: Will the proposed business/venture work, and should you proceed with it? <br> <br>
          Before you start to write your business plan, it's important that you first identify how, where, and to whom you intend to sell your product or service. You also need to assess your competition and figure out how much money you will need to start your business—and more importantly, how much it will take to keep it running smoothly until it is well established. <br>

A feasibility study also addresses such important issues as where (and how) the business will operate. If done properly, your feasibility analysis will provide in-depth details about all the various components of your business to determine if it can succeed. In the end, this document will serve as a valuable tool for developing a winning business plan. <br>

Why Feasibility Studies Are So Important ? <br>

The information you gather and present in your feasibility study will help you:
        </p>
        
        <ul>
          <li><p>Identify all the things you need to make the business work</p></li>
          <li><p>Pinpoint logistical and other business-related problems and solutions</p></li>
          <li><p>Develop <span>marketing strategies </span> to convince a bank or investor that your business is worth <br> considering as an investment</p></li>
          <li><p>Serve as a solid foundation for developing your business plan</p></li>
        </ul> 
        <p>
          Location, Location, Location <br>
Even if you have <span>a great business idea</span>, you'll have to find a cost-effective way to market and sell <br> your products or services. This is especially important for storefront retail businesses where the location  you choose could make or break your business. The right store in the wrong place is doomed to fail. <br> Most <span>commercial space leases</span>  place restrictions on businesses that can have a dramatic effect on income. <br> A lease might limit business hours or days, or parking spaces. It might restrict what products or services you can offer. <br>
In some cases, it can even limit the number of customers a business can receive each day. <br>
Also, you'll need to ask yourself if you should you rent space in a business park, industrial park, or retail location,because different types of commercial real estate properties all have pros and cons. <br>
<br>
6 Components of a Feasibility Study
        </p> 
          <ol>
            <li><p> <span> Description of the Business</span>. This describes the product or services to be offered. </p></li>
            <li><p>Market Feasibility. This includes a description of the industry, the current market, anticipated future market potential, competition, sales projections, and potential buyers.</p></li>
            <li><p><span>Technical Feasibility</span>. This details how you will deliver your product or service, including issues of materials, labor, transportation, where your business will be located, and the technology needed. </p></li>
            <li><p><span>Financial Feasibility</span>. You need to project how much startup capital you'll need and examine potential sources of capital and returns on investment.</p></li>
            <li><p><span>Organizational Feasibility</span>.This examines the legal and <span>corporate structure</span> of the business. You can also include professional background information about the founders of the business and what skills they can contribute to the business.</p></li>
            <li><p><span>Conclusions</span>. You should discuss how you envision the business succeeding. You need to be honest in your assessment because investors won't look at your conclusions and take that as proof. They should also look at the data and question your conclusions if they appear unrealistic.</p></li>
          </ol>
      <p>
        Feasibility studies contain comprehensive, detailed information about your business structure, products, services, and the market. They also examine the logistics of how you will deliver a product or service and the resources you need to make the business run efficiently.
